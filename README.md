# Podcast-Search-Engine
Ever watch a Ben Shapiro podcast and remember something he said but forgot what episode he said it in? 
I made a search engine for the Ben Shapiro Show that can find out how many times a given word or phrase has been said in his podcasts and which episode(s) 
it was mentioned in! The database currently holds all episodes found in this YouTube playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX_rhFRRlAG58_4z9KWPUYrnTM6QZDJrT.
